 Tracking Depression using Cognitive  science, EEG, and ML
Depression is turning out to be a major psychiatric disorder from which
many people in India and Netherlands alike are suffering.
Depression is associated with tremendous costs to society in terms of decreased productivity
and years lost due to disability. Specifically, for India, the social stigma associated with depression is a concern,
which leaves many cases of depression untreated.
In this project, we seek to develop an objective measure to diagnose and track depression. 
We also want to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying depression by combining state-of-the-art neuroscience with machine learning to detect depressogenic thinking online, 
as well as with computational modelling of cognition to develop more detailed theories about how depressogenic thinking is amplified and dampened by different interventions.
